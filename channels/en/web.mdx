# Web Channel Configuration

The **Web Channel** allows you to deploy your Agent as a standalone web page, accessible from any browser. Unlike the embedded Bubble, this option creates a direct link you can share with customers, making it simple for anyone to interact with your Agent without needing integration into an existing site.

## Share Link

Every Web Channel provides a unique link you can share with customers, partners, or internal teams.  
You can find this link in the **Share** section at the top of the Console page.

Example:
```
[https://consola.semantiks.com/external-chat?agent\_id=your-agent-id\&agent\_type=customer\_service](https://consola.semantiks.com/external-chat?agent_id=your-agent-id&agent_type=customer_service)
```

### Actions available
- **Copy link:** Use the “Copy” button to copy the full URL.  
- **Visit link:** Open the Agent’s web page directly in a new tab.  

<Note>
This makes it easy to distribute your Agent without embedding code or requiring external integrations.
