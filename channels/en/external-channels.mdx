The **External Channels** section enables you to connect your Agent with third-party providers so it can interact with users across popular messaging apps and service platforms.  

Unlike the Web and Bubble options, External Channels are tied to external providers (e.g., **Meta, Freshchat, Zendesk**), and each provider offers multiple **channels** (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger) with unique capabilities.  

---

## Integrate with a Provider

Available providers currently include:  
- **Meta** (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp) → [How to Integrate with Meta](/integration-guides/en/how-to-integrate-to-meta.mdx)  
- **Freshchat** (Callback URL integration) → [How to Integrate with Freshchat](/integration-guides/en/how-to-integrate-to-freshchat.mdx)  
- **Zendesk** (WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram) → [How to Integrate with Zendesk](/integration-guides/en/how-to-integrate-to-zendesk.mdx)  

Once a provider is integrated, you can **enable or disable** channels individually.  

---

## Enable a Channel

Each provider supports one or more channels. After integration, you can **enable or disable** channels individually. Once enabled, the Agent will be able to send and receive messages through that channel.

---

## Configure Add-ons

Each channel has add-ons that extend what the Agent can do. For example:  
- **WhatsApp:**  
  - Send/receive **voice notes**  
  - Enable **voice recognition**  
  - Process **image inputs** (e.g., OCR, classification)  
- **Messenger / Instagram:**  
  - Handle **rich media messages** (images, videos, stickers)  
  - Add **reaction handling**  
- **Freshchat:**  
  - Use **callback URLs** to link events back into your systems  

<Note>
Add-ons are optional and can be toggled on or off depending on the use case.  
**Important:** Some add-ons may have **additional costs** depending on provider pricing or platform usage.
</Note>

## Configuration

When configuring a channel, you can:  
- **Authenticate** with the provider (e.g., connect to a Meta or Zendesk account).  
- **Set permissions** for the types of content your Agent can handle (voice, images, rich media).  
- **Define behaviors** that determine how the Agent should respond to different input types.  

---

## Conversation Behaviors (by Channel)

Each channel supports unique input and output methods. Examples include:  
- **Text only** (basic fallback for all channels).  
- **Voice inputs/outputs** (e.g., WhatsApp voice notes).  
- **Image handling** (user uploads → Agent processes).  
- **File attachments** (e.g., PDFs or documents shared in Zendesk-integrated chats).  

<Note>
Conversation behaviors are evolving — future releases will expand supported input/output formats and customization.
