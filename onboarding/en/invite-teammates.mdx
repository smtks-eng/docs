# Inviting Team Members to Your Organization

Collaboration is a key aspect of managing AI agents effectively. Semantiks allows you to invite team members to your organization and assign them specific roles and permissions.

## User Roles in Semantiks

Before inviting team members, it's important to understand the different user roles available:

- **Admin**: Full access to all organization settings, agents, and analytics. Can invite and manage other users.
- **Editor**: Can create and edit agents, view analytics, and manage conversations.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to agents and analytics. Cannot make changes to agents or settings.

## Inviting New Team Members

</Steps>

## Managing Existing Team Members

Once users have joined your organization, you can manage their roles and access:

1. **Change User Roles**: Select a user and click "Edit" to change their role.
2. **Remove Users**: Select a user and click "Remove" to revoke their access to your organization.
3. **View Activity**: Monitor user activity and last login times.

## Best Practices for Team Management

- **Limit Admin Access**: Only give Admin roles to users who need to manage organization settings.
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically review user access and remove accounts that are no longer needed.
- **Role-Based Access**: Assign roles based on job responsibilities to maintain proper security.

<Note>
  Users will receive an email invitation with instructions on how to join your organization. If they don't already have a Semantiks account, they'll be prompted to create one.
