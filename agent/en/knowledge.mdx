## Adding Knowledge

If you are here you already **finished the onboarding**  and have your console ready to set-up. The first step would be adding some knowledge to the agent

**Knowledge is a key component of your agent.**\
The agent will only respond based on the information available in your knowledge base. This means that adding irrelevant data or lacking essential information can lead to a poor user experience. That's why setting up your knowledge base correctly is one of the most critical steps when configuring your agent.

### TOPICS

**You can organize your FAQs into different topics.**\
This helps the agent find answers more efficiently and accurately, while also making it easier for humans to locate, manage, and add new frequently asked questions.

### Adding FAQs

**You have three different options to build your knowledge base:**

- Manually insert FAQs
- Extract FAQs from documents **(Automatically generates Topics)**
- Extract FAQs from a link **(Automatically generates Topics)**

In this quick setup guide, we'll walk you through all three methods of generating knowledge for your agent.

### FAQs Manual Insert

**Manual FAQ insertion is extremely easy and involves just three simple steps:**\
Enter the question, provide the answer, and click save.

**Semantiks is full of Life Haks** and thats why we added this magic improve button.

![knowledge-step-5.png](/images/agent/knowledge/knowledge-step-5.png)

**The Magic Improve button automatically enhances both the question and the answer.**\
It keeps the original meaning intact while improving grammar, clarity, and overall phrasing to ensure everything is well-written and easy to understand.

**Just like the Magic Improve button, there's also an Improve Style button.**\
It works similarly, with one key difference: it improves either the question _or_ the answer individually, rather than both at the same time.

<Note>
  **Don't forget to save your changes by clicking the Save button\!**
  Otherwise, your improvements won't be applied.

### FAQs Document Insert

**Generating FAQs from documents is even simpler\!**\
Just drag and drop your files or click _Find File_ to upload up to 5 documents. The system will automatically generate FAQs based on their content.

**_You can either select specific questions to save or use the Select All button to save all generated FAQs at once._**\
Always remember to double-check your FAQs, as they are the foundation of your agent's knowledge and directly impact its performance.

### FAQs Link Insert

**Last but not least, there's the FAQs from Link option.**\
Simply paste a link, click _Generate FAQs_, and just like that your agent is ready to go\!

![knowledge-step-10.png](/images/agent/knowledge/knowledge-step-10.png)

**_Just like before, you can choose to save FAQs individually or use Select All to upload them all at once to the agent's knowledge base._**

### DEPLOY YOUR AGENT CHANGES

**This is a crucial step\!**\
You've just updated your agent's knowledge base—but it's not live for clients yet. After carefully reviewing all the updated FAQs, make sure to click the _Deploy_ button at the top of the console.\
This action publishes your changes and updates the agent's knowledge across all communication channels automatically.

<Note>
  If your agent's status is **green** and marked as **Active** — you're all set\!
  Your agent has been successfully updated and is ready to assist with the latest knowledge.

<Tip>
  You can test the newly updated knowledge base directly in the Playground.
  It's the perfect place to make sure your agent is responding accurately before going live.
