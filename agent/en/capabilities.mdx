# Tools (Predefined)

The **Tools (Predefined)** tab allows you to enable or disable built-in capabilities that your AI agent can use during conversations. Each tool represents a predefined function—such as answering FAQs, sending files, or escalating to a human agent—that can be toggled on or off depending on your business needs.  

When a tool is enabled, additional configuration may be required before the agent can use it successfully. Some tools also depend on the **type of channel** where the end user is interacting (e.g., WhatsApp, Zendesk, Freshchat).  

---

## How to Enable or Disable a Tool

1. Navigate to **Agents > Capabilities** in the left menu.  
2. Under **Tools (Predefined)**, locate the tool you want to manage.  
3. Use the **toggle switch** to turn the tool on or off.  
4. If the tool requires configuration, click **Configuration**, complete the required setup, and save your changes.  
5. Check that the tool is supported by the **channels** your agent is connected to.

## Available Predefined Tools

### 1. **Send Files**  
- **Description:** Allows the agent to send files directly to the user during a conversation.  
- **Default:** Always enabled.

---

### 2. **Answer FAQs**

### 3. **Collect Information**  
- **Description:** Enables the agent to collect, verify, and store user information (e.g., name, email, phone number) for lead generation or service requests.  
- **Toggle:** Off by default.  
- **Configuration:** Define the fields you want the agent to collect and where the data should be stored.  

<Note>  
This tool is **so important** that once enabled, it activates a dedicated **Collect Information tab** in the Capabilities section. From there, you can create, edit, and manage information collection configurations in detail.  
</Note>  

<Accordion title="How to Configure Collect Information">  
1. Go to **Agents > Capabilities > Collect Information**.  
2. Click **New Configuration** to start.  
3. Enter a **Name** for your configuration (e.g., `registro_interesados`).  
4. Add any **Special Instructions** to guide the agent (e.g., always capture user details if they show interest in your product).  
5. Define the **Fields to Collect** (e.g., name, surname, email, phone). Mark fields as **required** if necessary.  
6. Choose the **Integration Channels** where this configuration will apply (e.g., WhatsApp, Semantiks Console, Freshchat).  
7. (Optional) Add **Trigger Topics** to specify keywords or intents that activate the collection process.  
8. Save by clicking **Update configuration**.  

Once active, your configuration will appear in the **Collect Information tab**, showing:  
- Fields to collect  
- Trigger topics  
- Associated channels  
- Status (Active or Inactive)  
</Accordion>

### 4. **Human Escalation (Channel-Dependent)**  
- **Description:** Allows the agent to transfer a user from an AI conversation to a live support agent.  
- **Toggle:** Off by default.  
- **Channel Dependency:**  
  - This tool only appears when the agent is connected to certain customer service platforms such as **Zendesk** or **Freshchat**.  

<Accordion title="How to Configure Human Escalation">  
1. Connect your Zendesk or Freshchat account.  
2. Navigate to **Agents > Capabilities > Tools (Predefined)**.  
3. Locate **Human Escalation** and toggle it on.

5. Save your configuration to activate.  
</Accordion>

## Key Notes
- Tools marked **Default** (Send Files, Answer FAQs) are always available and cannot be disabled.  
- Tools that require **configuration** must be set up before they can be used by the agent.  
- Some tools (e.g., **Human Escalation**) will only appear if the agent is connected to a compatible **channel**.  
- **Collect Information** is unique: enabling it adds its own **tab** for deeper configuration.  
- You can revisit this tab at any time to adjust your enabled capabilities.
