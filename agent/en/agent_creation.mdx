<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: It's very important that you've completed the onboarding process and added enough base knowledge before moving on to this part of the tutorial.
  If not, the final user may have a poor experience when interacting with the agent. At Semantiks, we prioritize the end-user experience above all else.

## Connecting your agent to the world

**Having a super smart, capable, and fast agent sounds amazing—but if it's not connected to the world, it doesn't really matter.**\
In this step, you'll learn how to connect your agent to a live environment by:

- Embedding it into a web page using a simple copy-paste code snippet
- Integrating it with Meta WhatsApp as a messaging channel
- Serve your Agent using the "External Chat" URL

This ensures your agent is not only powerful, but also available where your users need it most.

<Note>
  **You'll find a step-by-step tutorial for each channel in the Channels section of the documentation.**
  Whether you're setting up a web widget or integrating with WhatsApp, Instagra,SMS, etc everything you need is right there.
</Note>

### External URL

**The external URL is the fastest way to share your agent.**\
This shareable link lets you provide a personalized chat experience where the agent is ready to answer questions and solve user problems.\
Most of the agent's tools and capabilities are available through this interface, making it a powerful option for quick deployment.

Find the channels section in the menu

### Web Bubble

**The external chat is great but what if you want to integrate your agent directly into your own website with a message bubble?**\
That's where the **Web Bubble Widget** comes in. This widget lets you embed the agent as a chat bubble anywhere on your site, giving users seamless access to support or interaction without leaving your page.

**_To get started, select the Web Bubble channel._**\
You'll first need to generate an **API key**, and then follow a simple two-step configuration:

1. **Copy the first code snippet** and paste it into the `<head>` section of your website.
2. **Copy the second code snippet** and paste it into the `<body>` section where you want the chat bubble to appear.

Once done, your agent will be live and ready to interact with users directly on your site\!
