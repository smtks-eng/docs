The **Playground** is a dedicated space inside the Semantiks Console where you can test your Agent’s behavior before deploying changes to live customer channels. It provides a controlled environment to simulate conversations, validate new capabilities, and refine responses without risking the user experience in production.

---

## Key Features

- **Safe Testing Environment:** Any changes you make to your Agent’s identity, knowledge, or capabilities can be tested here without impacting connected channels (WhatsApp, web chat, etc.).
- **Conversation Simulator:** Interact with your Agent in real time to evaluate how it responds to sample questions or guided prompts.
- **Predefined Prompts:** Start quickly with suggested inputs such as:
  - *¡Hola! ¿En qué me puedes ayudar?*  
  - *Cuéntame más sobre tu organización*
- **Restart Conversations:** Reset the chat at any time to test a new flow from the beginning.
- **Multilingual Support:** Test your Agent’s responses across different languages (if enabled).

## When to Use the Playground

Use the Playground whenever you want to:

- Validate **new knowledge entries** before making them public.
- Confirm that **capabilities** (integrations, tools, functions) are responding as expected.
- Train your team by showing them how the Agent behaves in controlled scenarios.
- Debug issues spotted in production without needing to replicate them directly with live customers.

## How to Access

1. Go to **Agents > Playground** in the left navigation menu.  
2. Select the Agent you want to test (e.g., *Customer Service – Ale*).  
3. Type your query or click a suggested prompt to begin testing.  
4. Use the **Restart Conversation** button on the top right to clear the session and start fresh.

## Best Practices

- **Iterate Frequently:** Test small changes in the Playground before pushing multiple updates to production.  
- **Compare Scenarios:** Use similar inputs across sessions to measure improvements in responses.  
- **Document Learnings:** Note issues or improvements needed and update the Agent’s knowledge or capabilities accordingly.  
- **Final Validation:** Always confirm in Playground that your Agent’s responses align with your organization’s tone and service goals before enabling changes on public channels.

By using the **Playground**, your team can confidently experiment, refine, and optimize Agents—ensuring that what goes live has already been tested for quality and reliability.
