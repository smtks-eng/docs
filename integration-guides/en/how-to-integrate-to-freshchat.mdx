<Tip>
This integration connects Freshchat (the messaging platform from Freshworks) with a Semantiks conversational agent. Messages sent by users through Freshchat will be automatically managed by our AI agent as the first line of support. If you have escalation enabled, users can be transferred to your human team in Freshchat when necessary.
</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get API Key and Base URL">

    The API Key and Base URL allow you to authenticate the integration from Semantiks to Freshchat.

    **Steps:**

    1. Go back to the main <strong>Admin Settings</strong> panel.
       ![Step 1 - Freshchat](/images/integration-guides/how-to-integrate-freshchat/fresh1.png)
    2. Now go to <strong>Marketplace and Integrations</strong>.  
    3. In this section, select <strong>API Settings</strong>.
       ![Step 4 - Freshchat](/images/integration-guides/how-to-integrate-freshchat/fresh4.png)
    4. Here you can view and copy:  
       - <strong>API Key</strong>
       - <strong>Base URL</strong>
         ![Step 5 - Freshchat](/images/integration-guides/how-to-integrate-freshchat/fresh5.png)

    It's very important to keep these values safe. The API Key is sensitive and should not be shared publicly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook and Get Public Key">

    The Webhook and Public Key are essential to ensure secure communication between Freshchat and Semantiks.

    **Steps:**

    1. Stay in the same <strong>API Settings</strong> section within <strong>Marketplace and Integrations</strong>, and select <strong>Conversation Webhooks:</strong>

       ![Step 7 - Freshchat](/images/integration-guides/how-to-integrate-freshchat/fresh7.png)
    3. Once enabled, in the first *Webhook* text box, paste this URL:
        ```bash Webhook URL
        https://semantiks-switchboard-922021458660.us-central1.run.app/webhooks/freshchat
        ```
        ![Step 8 - Freshchat](/images/integration-guides/how-to-integrate-freshchat/fresh8.png)
    4. When you activate the webhook, Freshchat will show you a <strong>Public Key</strong> in the *Authentication* section. Copy this key — it will be needed to verify that messages really come from Freshchat.
