## Understanding the Dashboard

Once your agent is live and fully configured, the **Dashboard** becomes one of your most powerful tools. It provides a visual overview of your agent’s performance and helps you understand how it interacts with users across time.

At the top of the dashboard, you’ll find a summary section with key performance indicators:

- **Total conversations**
- **Average duration**
- **User messages**
- **Agent messages**

Each metric is accompanied by a growth indicator to track improvements over time. You can switch between views such as _Today_, _7 Days_, _30 Days_, and _Year-To-Date (YTD)_.

## Conversation Summary

This panel shows the overall success rate of your agent. It visualizes how many of your conversations resulted in successful resolutions versus those that didn’t. Successful conversations are shown in blue, and failed ones in red.

This is especially useful to detect when something is not working as expected, either due to knowledge gaps, poorly phrased answers, or incorrect configurations. A high failure rate might mean your agent doesn’t understand the user’s intent, or that it doesn’t have the right information to respond properly.

The success rate is displayed as a percentage (e.g., 35.6% success), helping you measure how effective your agent is over time.

You can interact with the chart by hovering over each bar to see the exact number of successful and failed conversations on a given day.

<Note>
  Use this panel regularly to guide your optimization efforts. Every failed interaction is a learning opportunity to make your agent smarter and more efficient.

## Weekly Activity Distribution

This section breaks down the number of conversations by **day of the week**. It's ideal for identifying patterns—such as which days your agent is busiest—and preparing your team or automations accordingly.

## Hour Block Distribution

This donut chart breaks down all conversations into four main time blocks throughout the day

<Note>
  Early Morning (00:00–05:59)

  Morning (06:00–11:59)

  Afternoon (12:00–17:59)

  Evening (18:00–23:59)
</Note>

Understanding when your users are most active is essential for planning your automation strategies. This data allows you to:

- **Schedule rule triggers more effectively**
- **Adjust agent availability to match peak usage times**
- **Optimize your response window to improve user satisfaction**

Use this chart to spot consistent patterns in usage and make smarter decisions about how and when your agent should be most responsive.

## Hourly Activity Breakdown

This bar chart shows a much more granular view of conversation activity, broken down **hour by hour**. It’s perfect for detecting peak hours and fine-tuning when your automations or support team should be most responsive.

![Captura de pantalla 2025-06-16 a la(s) 5.15.56 p.m..png](/images/Capturadepantalla2025-06-16ala\(s\)5.15.56p.m..png)

<Note>
  All these metrics help you understand not only how much your agent is being used—but also **when** and **how well** it’s performing.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Keep a regular eye on the Dashboard. It’s the best way to catch early signs of underperformance and optimize your agent continuously.
