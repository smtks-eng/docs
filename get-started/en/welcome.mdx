## Types of AI Agents

Semantiks AI allows you to create four specialized types of AI agents, each designed for specific business needs:

### 1. Pre-sales Agents

Pre-sales agents are designed to engage potential customers, answer product questions, and guide prospects through the initial stages of the sales funnel. These agents can:

- Provide detailed product information
- Answer pricing and feature questions
- Qualify leads based on customizable criteria
- Schedule demos or meetings with sales representatives

### 2. Customer Service Agents

Customer service agents help existing customers resolve issues, find information, and get the support they need. These agents can:

- Troubleshoot common problems
- Process returns or exchanges
- Provide account information
- Escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary

### 3. Reactivation Agents

Reactivation agents focus on re-engaging dormant customers and bringing them back to your business. These agents can:

- Send personalized offers based on past purchase history
- Inform customers about new features or products
- Address reasons for customer inactivity
- Create targeted win-back campaigns

### 4. Personalized Agents

Personalized agents deliver tailored experiences based on individual customer preferences and history. These agents can:

- Provide recommendations based on past behavior
- Remember customer preferences across interactions
- Deliver customized messaging and offers
- Create a consistent experience across all channels
