## Types of AI Agents

Semantiks AI lets you create four specialized types of AI agents, each designed for specific business needs:

Provide detailed product information  
Answer questions about pricing and features  
Qualify leads based on customizable criteria  
Schedule demos or meetings with sales representatives

### 2. Customer Service Agents

Customer service agents help existing customers resolve issues, find information, and get the support they need. These agents can:

Solve common problems  
Process returns or exchanges  
Provide account information  
Escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary

### 3. Reactivation Agents

Reactivation agents focus on re-engaging inactive customers and bringing them back to your business. These agents can:

Send personalized offers based on purchase history  
Inform customers about new features or products  
Address reasons for customer inactivity  
Create targeted recovery campaigns

### 4. Personalized Agents

Personalized agents deliver tailored experiences based on individual customer preferences and history. These agents can:

Provide recommendations based on past behavior  
Remember customer preferences across interactions  
Deliver personalized messages and offers  
Create a consistent experience across all channels
