## Types of AI Agents

Semantiks AI lets you create four specialized types of AI agents, each designed for specific business needs:

### 1. Pre-Sales Agents

Pre-sales agents are designed to interact with potential customers, answer product questions, and guide prospects through the early stages of the sales funnel. These agents can:

- Provide detailed product information  
- Answer questions about pricing and features  
- Qualify leads based on customizable criteria  
- Schedule demos or meetings with sales representatives

### 2. Customer Service Agents

Customer service agents help existing customers resolve issues, find information, and get the support they need. These agents can:

- Solve common problems  
- Process returns or exchanges  
- Provide account information  
- Escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary

### 3. Reactivation Agents

Reactivation agents focus on re-engaging inactive customers and bringing them back to your business. These agents can:

- Send personalized offers based on purchase history  
- Inform customers about new features or products  
- Address reasons for customer inactivity  
- Create targeted recovery campaigns

### 4. Personalized Agents

Personalized agents allow you to create custom AI agents tailored to your unique business needs. These agents can serve purposes beyond Pre-Sales, Customer Service, or Reactivation, and can also combine features from multiple types to create hybrid solutions. For example, you can design agents for internal support, knowledge management, HR, or any other workflow that benefits from automation and intelligence.

These agents can:

- Combine capabilities from pre-sales, customer service, reactivation, or other domains
- Adapt to specialized or hybrid use cases unique to your organization
- Support workflows not related to sales, support, or reactivation (e.g., HR, internal helpdesk, knowledge management)
- Create a consistent experience across all channels

## Getting Started

To start creating your first AI agent, go to the Agents section in the console and select "Create New Agent." From there, you'll be guided through the process of selecting an agent type and configuring its capabilities.
